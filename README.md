# Disclaimer. Well, more of a foreword
I own... well, **NONE** of these fonts. Within each separate font's folder is another README, that'll also give credits to the creator/licensee of each one. Though, given that these were only meant to be used in a personal circumstance (I mean, that's why I've stuck these up here), I highly doubt it'll matter much. Still, it's better to make it more blatantly obvious

# Install?
Like the credits to each font, they'll be in each font's README. Come on, go ahead... you probably know how to import these already

# Credits across the whole board
- [Rairof](https://github.com/Rairof) for some of her packs in [Theme-Fonts](https://github.com/Rairof/Theme-Fonts) (Much of what's here is essentially a rework of hers)
- [2bytesforme](https://github.com/2bytes4me) for [sodosansbunny](https://github.com/2bytes4me/sodosansbunny)'s JSON structure (Since I forgot the former existed, until now)
