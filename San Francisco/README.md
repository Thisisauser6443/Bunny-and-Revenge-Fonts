# San Francisco for Bunny and Revenge

## So, what the heck is this font?
_"San Francisco is an Apple designed typeface that provides a consistent, legible, and friendly typographic voice. Across all Apple products, the size-specific outlines and dynamic tracking ensure optimal legibility at every point size and screen resolution. Numbers have proportional widths by default, so they feel harmonious and naturally spaced within the time and data-centric interfaces people use every day."_

From [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/), where you can get all of the variants of San Francisco, as well as its extensions

## Install Guide

## Disclaimer
It goes without saying, but **I __DO NOT__ OWN THESE FONTS**, as Apple have created them. However, this is only meant for personal usage, as opposed to commercial, so this shouldn't mean much, anyway
