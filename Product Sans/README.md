# Product Sans for Bunny and Revenge

## So, what the heck is this font?
_"Product Sans is a geometric sans-serif typeface created by Google for branding purposes.[2][3] It replaced the old Google logo on September 1, 2015. As Google's branding was becoming more apparent on multiple device types, Google sought to adapt its design so that its logo could be portrayed in constrained spaces and remain consistent for its users across platforms"_

Shamelessly stolen from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_Sans). These weren't even made publicly available, [as Google have stated in its license](https://fonts.google.com/license/productsans) (If you can even call it one, to begin with)

## Install Guide
1. Copy [this link](https://github.com/Thisisauser6443/Product-Sans/raw/refs/heads/main/Import.json) pointed to the JSON file
2. Make your way down to the `Fonts` section, under `Bunny` or `Revenge` in Discord's `Settings`
3. Hit the `+` button, and then hit `Import font entries from link`
4. Paste the link you copied earlier into the `Font Link` text field and hit `Import`
5. Verify that all 18 PostScript names are present, and have been populated with a unique link, and hit `Import`
6. You'll be brought back to the `Fonts` page. Hit `Apply` next to the new font entry, and `Reload`

## Disclaimer
**I __DO NOT__ OWN THESE FONTS**, as Google have created/owned them, in some shape or form. However, this is only meant for personal usage, as opposed to commercial, so this shouldn't matter much, anyway
